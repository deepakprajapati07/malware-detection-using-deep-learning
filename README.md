# malware-detection-using-deep-learning
Image-based malware detection and malware types classification using deep learning

## Project Work Summary
- Tried binary classification of malware and goodware on the following datasets
  - Grayscale images of size 128x128
  - Grayscale images of size 256x256
  - Color images of size 128x128
  - Color images of size 256x256
- Tried multiclass classification of malware on the following datasets
  - Grayscale images of size 128x128
  - Grayscale images of size 256x256
  - Color images of size 128x128
  - Color images of size 256x256

#### I have tried about 5 different architectures of pre-trained models on all the datasets and I found that Resnet 101 is giving the best results on Grayscale imgaes of size 128x128
#### In the Notebooks folder, all the final notebooks are stored
#### In the Other Notebooks folder, all the experiments notebooks are stored
